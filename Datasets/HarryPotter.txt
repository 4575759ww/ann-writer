Harry looked at Ron and presented his wand. Ron's face changed from a amber glow to a stale pale glare.
"Is that you know who's wand?" he whispered hesitantly. Harry gave rod an unnerving nod.
Hermione had always wanted to see Voldemort's wand as she was so fascinated with it. The wand shimmered as it sat eloquently in her hand.
"What does the engraving mean?" uttered harry, Hermione's face switched from an inspired stare into a happy smile.
"It means the wand was created in Mordoor" she replied. "The average time it takes to fly to Hogwart's in out car is way longer then we first thought" said harry.
He threw on his invisibility cloak and began to run toward the sky blue car. "It would take us 3 days to travel that far" cried Ron. Rons stare
changed from a friendly smile to a concerned frown. the tree's swayed in the wind above them, each creak of the branches echod through the forest
like a howling ghost. You could feel the terror that surrounded the group grow as time slowly passed. Harry, Ron and Hermione had been standed
together for 3 hours and they were still nowhere closer to Hogwart's castle.
