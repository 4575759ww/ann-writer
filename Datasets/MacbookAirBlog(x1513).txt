If you're looking for a machine that's going to handle whatever you can throw at it, you're going to want the MacBook Pro.
If you're looking for something that's portable and more than capable of handling every day tasks,
you're going to want to look at the MacBook Air. And if you want the newest technology, the latest form factor,
the ultimate in portability, and you don't mind the price tag, the MacBook is the machine for you.
The Retina MacBook Pro is Apple's workhorse MacBook, with the fastest processors, the best graphics,
and the most available RAM (via upgrade). If you want to do things like serious photo, video, or audio editing,
this is the Mac for you. Use Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, or Logic Pro X on a regular basis? You probably need a MacBook Pro.

You're also going to want to choose a MacBook Pro if you want a machine capable of playing modern system-intensive games.
Don't care about games and just want to do things like browse the Internet, write papers, and answer emails?
The MacBook Pro may be more computer than you need -- consider a MacBook Air if you don't care about a Retina screen,
or a MacBook if you don't mind the price.
Within the MacBook Pro family, there are 13 and 15-inch models and several different configurations at various price points.
As the price goes up, so does the power. Most of Apple's MacBook Pro models have a Retina screen, aside from the 13-inch
MacBook Pro priced at $1,099. You don't want to buy this model -- it's years old and technologically lagging way behind newer models.

In the past, many people have chosen a MacBook Pro because it was the only notebook that offered a Retina display,
but with the recent addition of the 12-inch two-pound MacBook, there's no longer a need to compromise between portability
and a decent display. If you don't need the power of a MacBook Pro but want a Retina display, the MacBook is now the machine to choose.
The MacBook Pro is Apple's most powerful notebook, but be warned: it's also the biggest and heaviest.
The 13-inch version weighs in at 3.48 pounds and the 15-inch version is 4.46 pounds. That doesn't sound like much in print,
but carrying four pounds on your back all day is a lot more taxing than 2 or 3 -- the weight of Apple's lighter notebooks.
All Retina MacBook Pro models have two thunderbolt ports and two USB 3.0 ports, along with an HDMI port, a headphone port, and an SD card slot.
So, 13-inch or 15-inch? The 15-inch machines are more powerful, with quad-core processors, Intel Iris Pro Graphics,
and the option for a discrete graphics card, and (obviously) a bigger display, but they're also more expensive.
The 13-inch models have dual-core processors and are limited to integrated graphics.
After a recent update to the 15-inch model, both the 13 and 15-inch Retina MacBook Pros come with a pretty cool Force Touch trackpad that has new gestures, and they've got speedier flash storage.

The 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro was last updated in March of 2015 and the 15-inch model was last updated in May of 2015.
The 13-inch model got new Broadwell processors, but the 15-inch model continues to use Crystalwell processors in the Haswell family.
These aren't quite as speedy or efficient as Broadwell processors, but Intel's delays have prevented Apple from introducing processor upgrades.
We don't expect to see another update to the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro for several months to come,
but the next model will use improved Broadwell or Skylake processors.
All of these models have custom build-to-order options that let you boost the processor, the SSD, and the RAM for extra money. On the high end, you can get a 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro with a 3.1GHz dual-core Broadwell processor, 16GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD or a 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro with a 2.8GHz quad-core Crystallwell processor, 16GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD.

Beyond choosing a specific MacBook Pro model, you also need to decide whether you want to make any additional build-to-order upgrades.
It's important to note that these components can't be upgraded later, so you need to think ahead to what you might need in the future.
Upgrading the RAM or the CPU will keep your machine feeling fast longer.
Need a ton of storage space for videos and photos? Get the storage upgrade.
Want the best gaming performance? You'll want to opt for the higher-end 15-inch Retina MacBook, which has a discrete graphics card.
Do complex 3D modeling, intensive video/audio/photo editing tasks often? The extra RAM might be worthwhile.
Individual workloads are going to vary significantly,
so there's no one-size-fits-all solution for all users -- that's why Apple offers so many options.
When deciding between a 15-inch model and a 13-inch model, aside from display size and price, the biggest difference is the processor.
With the 15-inch model, you're getting a quad-core processor, but with the 13-inch model, it's dual-core.
Quad-core processors are better if you plan to do a lot of multitasking with many apps open at once,
or if you plan on playing intensive games, you'll benefit from a quad-core processor.
Single-core performance between the two MacBooks is similar,
but multi-core performance is much better in the quad-core 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro.
Need the ultimate in power and money is no object? Go with the 15-inch model.
On a budget but still want more power than a MacBook Air will provide? Get the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro.
It's still a powerful machine that's going to do all of your photo, video, and audio editing tasks with ease.

The MacBook Air used to be Apple's most portable computer, but with the introduction of the 12-inch super thin MacBook,
it's now just Apple's most affordable notebook. Its low price tag comes at a cost -- it's the only notebook in Apple's
lineup without a Retina display. The 11-inch model's display has a resolution of 1366 x 768, while the 13-inch model's display
has a resolution of 1440 x 900.
It's not Apple's lightest portable notebook anymore (that title goes to the 2.03-pound MacBook),
but the MacBook Air is still lighter and thinner than the Retina MacBook Pro. The 11-inch model weighs in at 2.38 pounds,
while the 13-inch model weighs 2.96 pounds. Both models are 0.68 inches thick.
If you're on a budget and need a portable laptop for under $1,000 that's powerful enough for your day to day needs like web browsing,
email, and light application use, the MacBook Air is the notebook to choose. It'll handle some games and apps like Photoshop and Final Cut Pro,
but it won't do as well as the MacBook Pro. If you have a bigger budget, the Retina displays of the MacBook Pro and the MacBook are worth the extra money.
There is another situation where you might want to choose the MacBook Air over the MacBook or the MacBook Pro,
and that's if you need portability and ports. The MacBook Pro is heavier (and thus less portable),
and while the MacBook is thinner and lighter, it's only got one USB-C port, which might not fit into some workflows.
If you need Thunderbolt and standard USB ports, don't want to deal with adapters, and don't mind the lack of a Retina display,
the MacBook Air might be the machine for you.
